Freecodecamp-Legacy-JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures Practice

This repository contains my JavaScript practice from the Freecodecamp course.
I'm currently learning the fundamentals of programming and building interactive apps step by step.

Each folder includes a separate project or small coding challenge.
I use GitHub from Day 1 to show progress and consistency.

Why I'm sharing this:

To build my developer portfolio
To track learning progress
To show potential employers my commitment to becoming a Full-Stack JavaScript Developer
Thanks for checking out my code!
